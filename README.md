# Amazon Bestsellers Web Scraper

This project is a Python-based web scraper built using Selenium to extract product details from the Amazon Bestsellers page across multiple categories. The script collects data such as product names, prices, ratings, links, shipping details, seller information, discounts, and image URLs.

Key features:

Handles dynamic web elements and errors for smooth execution.
Outputs data into category-specific CSV files for easy access and analysis.
Includes a login function (commented out) for accessing restricted pages, though login was not required for this task.
The script is scalable to fetch a larger dataset and demonstrates proficiency in web scraping and data handling.
